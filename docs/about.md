The name Panda who never sleeps, because I am very fond of Pandas. And this work/blog was created during the nights, so "The Panda who never sleeps". Currently, I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science - Intelligent Systems from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. I had previously worked as Software Developer for 3 continuous years and follows photography by heart.
