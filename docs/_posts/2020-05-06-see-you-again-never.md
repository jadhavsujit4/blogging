  Hello reader. My name is Sujit Jadhav, 25 years old and this is my first time trying something like this.I hope this blog is relatable to you and can add some value. So basically, this story covers few instances of my life. The instances are related to love or friendship more often and how I dealt with those things. These are a bit heart touching and sensitive issues where I decided to be with few people and lost many in the process.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first instance happened to me during my childhood days, when I realised what it takes to make life decisions. There was a girl to whom I got very close. We used to talk a lot and shared everything, be it good or bad, exciting or boring, basically every small thing that was going on in our respective lives. We went out together often and I would sometimes even help do her daily chores. She always called me for some or the other help and obviously I always  helped her out, just as a family member would do 'cause she was really close to me. There was this one time when we were returning from some work and there was some issue with her mobile phone, to which I told her that I would try to fix it. And I tried to do it, but due to some reason, the phone didn't work and got worse. For this, here parents scolded her and asked her to have no contact with me. I sort of got this idea by talking to her and we soon began to talk less. This was the first time I lost someone, a very precious person for just a petty reason, which wasn't my mistake. What hurted me the most was that she broke our friendship for such a small thing, to which I decided to never see her again.

  The year went by and I met a new person. We were made to sit together by our teacher and being a naughty boy, I always irritated my benchpartner. She was so used to it that she would call out someone else using my name(ofcourse it used to be a mistake, but due to her habit of always yelling at me). We seemed to be good friends then, but then a something unusual happened. I became insecure of her talking to other guys in the class, which made me angry. After which I decided to get away from her, changed my sitting place, talked way too less to her and gave myself punishment of never seeing her again.

  What makes me an idiot here is that just to suffice my tiny ego and attitude, I left people. I left everyone of them who played with my feelings, who destroyed me when they didn't stood up for me when I always stood up for them. Sometimes, it is not about about ego and attitude, it is also about self respect and this was the main reason for me leaving people. This can be understood by the next event during my graduation studies. Being an introvert, I talked with less people and was never into socialising with a group of people. But then life happened, where I met 3 girls and got close to them in a very short span of time. We even celebrated festivals, college events together wearing same kind of clothes; that was the level of our friendship. This was not only it; We also planned to go on a trip together, which every group does, but here I felt special because I was the only boy in the group. We trekked places together, went out eating junk food like every chance we had. Life seemed happiest as one of them helped me to get through my breakup. But, for how long can a person be happy? The group decided to go on a trek without informing/inviting me, to which I thought that they can feel uncomfortable. So I accepted it, but later found out that they lied to me and enjoyed the trek with our another college friend, which made me furious. This was the line they could have not crossed which shattered me. From then on, I decided to not get involved in any of the activities with them, not to talk to any one of them, no replies to them. All this, just to save my self respect, which helped me at that moment as we became apart and moved ahead with out life. From then on, I never spoke to anyone in my remaining years of graduation. But the truth is, the two of them were still good friends and seeing them made me miss the time spent with them. I made this decision in anger and left them, which later on I thought of as a mistake. I still don't know what I did was a mistake or the right thing to do. I will leave that to you to decide. But the bottom line is, I still miss them a lot and would love to be in contact with all three of them.

  This started to become more of a habit than self respect thing. This one you can relate with your life closely. We all have made friends over the years. Some close, some best friends while some who only talk to you when they need you. From school days to working, we get to meet many people but only get to know few of them, be it a building friend or just a colleague. When we are with them, we enjoy a lot, we plan things with them. However, when we move from one job opportunity to another one, we somewhere forget the plans, not the people. They are still there in your life, but have a very limited contact with them probably because of our hectic lifestyle that's what people say.People totally believe this bullshit, if you are friends to someone, there would be less compromises and more of retardness in the form of enjoyment. We understand each and everyone, we understand our friends schedule, but compromising in friendships is a lot to take in. In this compromises, we either decide to go with the flow, or just say see you again - never.

  This is the final story in this post, a story which I am currently living in. Like many others, I don't have any personal contact with most of my work friends, but few chose to stay with me, connect with me. Few College friends with whom I chose to stay for my future. Life moved slowly into happiness and then things happened. I am studying Masters in Ireland, but had to come back to India due to COVID-19. Things were still sorted, but then again the real faces of few were revealed. One of my close friend, instead of supporting me in a right/wrong judgement, fair/unfair decision, chose to support the wrong side just for his personal gain. I was surprised to know about this and my future plans with that person shattered. I am still in awe with the decision made by my friend, and still have no idea whether to trust that person anymore again. At this juncture I had fights with that person and we decided to not talk for sometime. The fight was due to few misunderstandings from my end, which I clarified, which I accepted and tried to sort it out. But, what my mind was going through for this kinf of decision could not be explained. Crying was only one thing which I could do. I am still unsure whether to leave this person or not. Will it be worth staying with person who made me cry for such small things, who left me in dry? The quesion is will I "See you again - Never" ?
