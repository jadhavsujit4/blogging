  Hello reader. My name is Sujit Jadhav, 25 years old and this is my first time trying something like this. I hope this blog is relatable to you and can add some value. So basically, this story covers a few instances of my life. The instances are related to either love or friendship, but more often to the latter and how I dealt with them. This tells the story about the decisions I had to take in these instances where I decided to be with few people and lose many in the process. Reasons are many, but the most important one would be self-respect.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first instance happened with me during my schooling when I realised what it takes to make life decisions. There was a girl to whom I got very close. We used to talk a lot and shared everything, be it good or bad, exciting or boring, basically every small thing that was going on in our lives. We went out together often and I would sometimes even help do her daily chores. She always called me for some help and obviously, I always helped her out, just as a family member would do cause she was close to me. There was this one time when we were returning from some work and there was some issue with her mobile phone, to which I told her that I would try to fix it. And I tried to do it, but due to some reason, I made it worse. For this, here parents scolded her and asked her to have no contact with me. I sort of got this idea by talking to her and we soon began to talk less. This was the first time I lost someone, a very precious person for just a petty reason. What hurts me the most was that we broke our friendship for such a small thing, to which I decided to never see her again.

  The year went by and I met another person as we move on in life. This person and I were made to sit together by our teacher and being a naughty boy, I always irritated my bench partner. She was so used to my mischievous that she would call out some other person using my name (of course it used to be a mistake, but due to her habit of always yelling at me). We seemed to be good friends but then something unusual happened. I became insecure about that person interacting with anyone else, which made me angry. After which I decided to get away from her, have no more interaction with her and stopped talking to her like she was nothing for me. Here, this was all due to the fear of losing something in the process, fear of losing that person or even thinking that the person might get accustomed with the other person easily and forget the bind we had. This caused the insecurities among us which then I decided to never see my friend again.

  What makes me an idiot here is that just to suffice my tiny ego and attitude, I left people. I left every one of them who played with my feelings, who destroyed me when they didn't stand up for me when I always stood up for them. Sometimes, it is not just about ego and attitude, but more about self-respect and this was the main reason for me leaving people. I truly below the below quote:

  
```yaml
“I cannot compromise my respect for your love. You can keep your love, I will keep my respect.”
 ― Amit Kalantri, Wealth of Words
```

  This can be understood by the next event during my graduate studies. Being an introvert, I talked with fewer people and was never into socialising with other people in my class. But then life happened, where I met a group of girls and got close to them in a very short time. We even celebrated festivals, college events together wearing the same kind of clothes; which defines the level of our friendship. This was not only it; We also planned to go on a trip together, which every group does, but here I felt special because I was the only boy in the group. We trekked places together, went out eating junk food whenever we got the chance. Life seemed happiest as one of them helped me to get through my tough times. But, for how long can a person be happy? The group decided to go on a trek without informing/inviting me, to which I thought that they can feel uncomfortable. So I accepted it but later found out that they lied to me and enjoyed the trek with our another college friend, which made me furious. This was the line they could have not crossed which shattered me and made me even angrier. From then on, I decided to not get involved in any of the activities with them, to not talk to anyone of them, no replies to them. All this, just to save my self-respect, which helped me at that moment as we became apart and moved ahead with our life. From then on, I never spoke to anyone in my remaining years of graduation. But the truth is, seeing them still being in a group and getting more attached to each other made me miss the time I spent with them. I made this decision in anger and left them, which later on I thought of as a mistake. I still don't know what I did was a mistake or the right thing to do. It's better to leave that to others to decide. But the bottom line is, I still miss them a lot and would love to be in contact with all of them.

  This started to become more of a habit than a self-respect thing. This one you can relate to your life closely. We all make friends over the years. Some close, some best while some who only talk to you when they need you. From school days to work, we get to meet many people but only get to know a few of them, be it your friend who stays nearby you or just a colleague. When we are with them, we enjoy a lot, we plan things with them. However, when we move away from them say for one job opportunity to another, we somewhere forget the plans, not the people. They are still there in your life but have very limited contact with them probably because of their hectic lifestyle, that's what people say. People believe this bullshit if you are friends to someone, there would be fewer compromises and more of retardedness in the form of enjoyment. We understand each and everyone, we understand our friends' schedule, but compromising in friendships is a lot to take in. In these compromises, we either decide to go with the flow, or just say see you again - never.

  This is the final story in this post, a story which I am currently living in. Like many others, I don't have any personal contact with most of my work friends, but few chose to stay with me, connect with me. Few college friends with whom I chose to stay in contact forever. Life moved slowly into happiness and then things happened. I am studying Masters in Ireland but had to come back to India due to COVID-19. Things were still sorted, but then again the real faces of few were revealed. People make choices in which they think whats best for them or where they are gaining something, even if it is a wrong choice. Such an incident caught me by surprise and a few plans with that person shattered. I am still in awe with the decision made by my friends, and still have no idea whether to trust them anymore. Due to some misunderstandings, I fought with my friend and just get disappointed with few words used by my friend. To cool off things, my friend decided to give some space and not have any communication for some time. This seems fair decision, however for a person like me, who overthinks situations like these, fears of losing the other person in the meantime. The decision to not communicate at all gave me anxiety and was not in any condition to discuss anything further. Being angry was one thing, but crying in the fear of the future was another that weakened me. What my mind was going through for this kind of decision could not be explained. This fear of losing someone with a change in their behaviour was stressing me. The thing here is that to keep ourselves happy, we never think of the opposite person, even for a single time. The thing here is that we cannot make these harsh decisions but the opposite person can make it without giving any other thought. I didn't want to lose this one, so had to compromise or so what I think I did. The decisions never changed even by knowing how deeply I felt by their decision. It is still unsure whether to see this person again or never.
